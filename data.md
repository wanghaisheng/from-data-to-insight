### Additional Notes:
- **Raw Data:** This refers to unprocessed output directly from sensors, which often requires further interpretation or conversion to be meaningful.
- **Processed Data:** This is the result of applying algorithms or calculations to raw sensor data, providing users with actionable insights.
- **Second Use Data:** This refers to previously collected data that can be re-analyzed or repurposed for new applications, such as training machine learning models or validating new algorithms.
