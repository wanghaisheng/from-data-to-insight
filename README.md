Strava


Hello, I am looking for a fitness gamification app. It should include features such as leveling and achievements. Additionally, it should have daily or weekly tasks like running and fitness exercises such as crunches or push-ups. The app should also allow users to share and compare their progress with others, and provide the option to work out together on tasks for added enjoyment.
